# Configuring Online Search Functionality

LobeChat supports configuring online search functionality for AI, allowing it to access the latest web information and provide more accurate and timely responses. The online search feature is based on the [SearXNG](https://github.com/searxng/searxng) search engine, which is a privacy-respecting metasearch engine that aggregates results from multiple search engines.

<Callout type={'info'}>
  SearXNG is an open-source metasearch engine that can be self-hosted or accessed via public instances. By configuring SearXNG, LobeChat enables AI to retrieve the latest internet information, allowing it to answer time-sensitive questions and provide up-to-date news.

# Core Environment Variables

## `SEARXNG_URL`

The URL of the SearXNG instance, which is a necessary configuration to enable the online search functionality. For example:

```shell
SEARXNG_URL=https://searxng-instance.com
```

This URL should point to a functional SearXNG instance. You can choose to self-host SearXNG or use a publicly available SearXNG instance.

You can find publicly available SearXNG instances in the [SearXNG instance list](https://searx.space/). Choose an instance that is fast and reliable, and then configure its URL in LobeChat.

> Note that the `searxng` you use must have `json` output enabled; otherwise, the `lobe-chat` call will result in an error.
> If self-hosting, find the `searxng` configuration file and add `json` as shown below.

```bash
$ vi searxng/settings.yml
...
search:
  formats:
    - html
    - json
```

# Verifying Online Search Functionality

After configuration, you can verify whether the online search functionality is working correctly by following these steps:

1. Restart the LobeChat service.
2. Start a new chat session, enable smart online search, and then ask AI a question that requires the latest information, such as "What is the current gold price today?" or "What are the latest major news stories?"
3. Observe whether AI can return the latest information based on internet searches.

If AI can answer these time-sensitive questions, it indicates that the online search functionality has been successfully configured.
